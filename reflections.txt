## How long did you spend working on this project?

I spend around 4 hours to complete this project

## What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?

Premature optimization is the root of all evil.
Hard to know when to think more and when to think less

## What two additional features did you build? Why?

### Feature 1

Old transction could only buy a product with quantity 1,
I modified the transction so thant customer can buy
product with many quantity. This is more natural.

### Feature 2

Old customer only has name attribute,
I add age and gender because I think that when analysing
customer, age and gender are very important, for example,
we may want to classify customer base on their age and gender.

## Room to grow

* one transction can contain diffrent products, so
that we can analysing products that are tend to bought
together

* we can store revenue for each product
